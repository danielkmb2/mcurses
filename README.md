mcurses
=======

Awesomely pointless curses music visualizer
Capture your default sound output and plots color bins out of each frecuency.


You'll need some no-standard libraries:
	python2-pyaudio
	python2-decimal
	python2-curses

Known bugs:
	The thing will explode if you try to resize the window
	Still captures low frecuency values when theres nothing playing 
	Ridiculously efficiency
	Dropped frames can fuck up the visualization

Also you can do whatever you want with this if you want :3
